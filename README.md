## Description
##Welcome page
This website uses a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript code to create a fun and exciting experience for the user. When the user opens the welcome page, they are presented with the name of the webpage 'Picturesque', this is a large heading element with golden art deco styling and border surrounding. The name Picturesque was chosen as the word fit well with the film aspect and fit well with our choice in branding. The golden art deco styling and black background was used throughout the website as a branding choice as it looked elegant and matched the 1920 cinema golden cinema style. Another eye-catching element for the user is the glowing light up search bar and “search for a movie” heading. This was created using google font “yellow tail”, drop shadows and a background image in CSS. The user can search for a film by typing into the search bar and pressing enter; this adds interactivity to the site. When typing autofill dropdown options will appear to make this process quicker for the user, improving on the user experience. At the bottom of the welcome page, there is a slick carousel that loops through a number of film posters. This was created so that the user can also select a film instead of searching for a specific name. This was created using a jQuery ui and is not only helpful for the user but also looks dynamic and adds movement to the page. 

## Main page


## Usage
This application is very interactive, clear and easy for users to navigate. The user has the ability to enter the name of a film in the search bar. As the user types they will notice an auto fill option, they have the option use this and save time in typing a film to search. A user can use autofill by selecting an option from the drop-down list that appears when typing. Once the user has finished typing, they can search for the film by pressing enter on the keyboard, once clicked the page will display the film poster, title, rating, actors, plot, genre, year of release and the name of the country where the film was created along with a map displaying the location. Should the user click the poster; they are then presented with a modal displaying the trailer of that film, they can then click play and watch the film. The user can close the model by selecting the close button below. The user may also notice to the left of the screen that their recent searches have been added. The user also has the ability to click their recently searched films. If the user selects a film from the search history, they are redirected to the same information page with the according film’s poster, title, rating, actors, plot, genre, year of release, country and map. 
Additionally, an “add to watchlist” button is provided for every film underneath the film information. If a user selects this button, they will see a message below telling them that either the film has been added to their watchlist or that it is already part of their watchlist. When a user clicks the button view my watchlist, on the left side of the screen, they will be directed to the my watchlist page. Once the user has selected this, they will see all of the posters of films they have chosen. If the user selects the image poster, they will see a modal containing a brief overview of the film plot, title, rating and cast/actors. If the user wishes the close the modal, they can click anywhere on the page outside of the modal. If a user wishes to remove particular films from their watch list, they can select the red cross button in the top left corner. To leave the my watchlist page the user can select the “back to homepage” button at the top of the page. The user may also notice the selection of film posters rotating/scrolling at the bottom of the page. This allows the user to select a film through clicking on the poster rather than typing or having to think of a specific film on their own. If the user clicks one of these posters, they are directed to the information page about that film. If a user wishes to return to the homepage, they can select the “back to main” button.
